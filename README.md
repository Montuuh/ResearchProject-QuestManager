# Introduction
This is a research on a Quest System, with an educational matter and learn how can it be implemented to the [big project](https://github.com/WillyTrek19/Project-19-2000), a 2D turn-based RPG, for the Project II subject at the  Bachelor's degree in Video Game Design and Development in CITM.
The research consists of a concept discovery and implementation of a Quest Manager and a basic game environment to test it graphically.
# Research Description
This research consists of an implementation of a basic Quest Manager. It's a unique class that handles with the data and the logic for all of the quests in the game. It's focus is to be implemented in a turn-based RPG game, so having complex quests may not be necessary.
For storing the quest data, it uses a .xml document, that the code will manage later.
